# mlbstatsapi.mlb_dataadapter.MlbDataAdapter.get() calls requests.get() with no timeout, so a
# stalled upstream connection (statsapi.mlb.com not responding, a hung proxy, etc.) blocks the
# calling thread forever instead of failing. Under concurrent tool calls this exhausts the
# server's worker pool and stalls unrelated requests too - observed in production as every
# in-flight get_mlb_search_players/get_mlb_player_info call hanging for exactly 300s, which was
# actually the *caller's* client-side timeout tearing down the connection, not ours. Patch in a
# bounded timeout so a stalled upstream fails fast with a normal {"error": ...} response.
